*   Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their shopping cart from the Home page. The shopping cart icon in the navigation bar displays the number of items in the cart. Clicking on the icon opens a modal window displaying the items in the cart along with their quantities and prices. Users can remove items from the cart or proceed to checkout.
